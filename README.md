Create another list containing tuples. Each tuple will hold the name of a spacecraft that we have launched, and the names of the planet(s) that it has visited, or landed on. (e.g. ('Cassini', 'Saturn')).

Iterate over your list of planets, and inside that loop, iterate over the list of tuples. Print, for each planet, which sattelites have visited.
